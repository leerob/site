Software is a competitive field – you should take advantage of every opportunity to stand out from the competition. A simple, yet effective way is to create a portfolio.

Those who had a portfolio on their resume where I could learn more about them, their projects, and the code they've written were more likely to get a response from me when interviewing.

Here are some tips for creating a portfolio that stands out:

- **Show code:** Ideally links to GitHub repositories, including live demo URLs where I can see the things you've built. I'll go explore the codebase and see what tech choices you used. Bonus points if you wrote about _why_ you picked that tech stack.
- **Write stuff:** An average engineer who can write well and explain concepts clearly is better than an excellent engineer who can't communicate with their coworkers. Show me you are a clear writer, which is especially important if the role is remote.
- **Own your SEO:** Google yourself and make sure you own the first page (not always easy, but worth influencing). Capture a domain name and build credibility. You might end up keeping that "digital home" throughout your career.
- **Make it unique:** Express yourself. Use a creative design. Spent the extra hour on the [animation polish](https://delba.dev/blog/a-like-button-that-likes-you-back). Add [something unique](https://bruno-simon.com/) you haven't seen others do before.
- **Show, don't tell:** You _said_ you have experience with React – show me.
