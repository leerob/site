summary: 'Why is there so much recruiter spam? What can we do to fix technical recruiting?'

On my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leejamesrobinson/), I explicitly list what I'm looking for in a position to help
receive more targeted, relevant messages.

Unfortunately, this is assuming that most recruiters actually _read_ my profile. If they did,
I wouldn't get emails like this.

I explicitly list what I _don't_ want, yet still, get tons of recruiter spam. Why is this?

## Buying vs. Selling

Hiring is becoming increasingly more difficult, especially in a place with a [limited talent pool](https://innovationia.com/2019/01/03/dsmtech-io-launches-for-tech-job-seekers-scouting-des-moines/) and
the [lowest unemployment rate](https://whotv.com/2019/01/22/iowa-now-has-the-lowest-unemployment-rate-in-the-nation/) in the nation (2.4%).
This leads to companies outsourcing or supplementing hiring by working with third parties.

The bottom line is: **the people you're trying to recruit already have a job**. The focus needs to be on
_selling them_ the position. Let's take a look at some examples. What kind of subject line works best?

What does that even mean? Is that an engineer?

Okay, that's a bit better.

This one _really_ got my attention 😂

## Building Relationships

Good recruiters focus on building relationships versus solving an immediate need.
I'm not actively looking for a new position right now, but I might be in the future. When a recruiter leaves a positive impression,
I'm more likely to return to them when the timing is right.

Rather than dwell on the negatives, I'd like to take this opportunity to highlight some positive messages I've received
from recruiters and CEOs.
