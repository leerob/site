I've spent a lot of time in the past 4 months creating [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) apps for both work and personal use.

- I ported over my personal site from [Hugo](/blog/migrating-to-hugo) to [Next.js + MDX](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io).
- I created [dsmtech.io](https://dsmtech.io/) (and explored using [Mapbox](/blog/using-mapbox-with-next-js)).
- A handful of projects at [Hy-Vee](https://innovate.hy-vee.com/) are being [rebuilt with Next.js](https://stackshare.io/hy-vee/hy-vee-aisles-online).

Along that journey, I've grown to really ❤ Next.js and it's ecosystem. Here are some of the things I've learned along the way.

## CSS Modules

I've worked with CSS, Sass, CSS-in-JS, and now CSS Modules. For most applications, I'd recommend CSS Modules.

CSS Modules prevent naming collisions and keep you from loading excess styling.
They're built [directly into Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-component-level-css), making it easy to get started.

For more information, check out [How Should I Style My React Application?](/blog/css-with-react)

## Font Loading

By using `@font-face` in combination with the `font-display` [attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/font-display), I can prevent FOUT (Flash of Unstyled Text) and FOIT (Flash of Invisible Text).

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Inter';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 100 900;
  font-display: optional;
  src: url(/fonts/inter-var-latin.woff2) format('woff2');
  unicode-range: U+0000-00FF, U+0131, U+0152-0153, U+02BB-02BC, U+02C6, U+02DA,
    U+02DC, U+2000-206F, U+2074, U+20AC, U+2122, U+2191, U+2193, U+2212, U+2215,
    U+FEFF, U+FFFD;
}
```

Further, I can [preload](https://web.dev/preload-critical-assets/) my optimized font file in the `Head` of my document.

**Update:** For more information, check out [Web Fonts in 2021](/blog/fonts).

## Dynamic Imports and Testing

It's likely that at some point in scaling your Next.js app, you'll want to use an external package
that doesn't work well server-side rendered. For me, this package was [react-select](https://react-select.com).

When SSR this component, it simply did not work in Safari. Until that bug is fixed, I needed a workaround. Thanks
to Next's [Dynamic Imports](https://nextjs.org/docs/#dynamic-import), it's easy to import a component and disable SSR.

```jsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const ReactSelectNoSSR = dynamic(() => import('../components/select'), {
  ssr: false,
});

export default () => (
  <>
    <Header />
    <ReactSelectNoSSR />
    <Footer />
  </>
);
```

While this works, we can go a step further and provide a [loading placeholder](/blog/loading-placeholder-with-sass) to make the user experience better.

```jsx
const ReactSelectNoSSR = dynamic(() => import('../components/select'), {
  loading: () => <Input />,
  ssr: false,
});
```

## MDX

My [portfolio](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io) has transformed quite a bit since I started it in 2014. Originally, it was
just static HTML & CSS. Then, I [switched over to Hugo](/blog/migrating-to-hugo) so I could write my posts in Markdown.
This worked well for a while, but I wanted full control over my layouts and felt much more comfortable with JavaScript.
That's what led me to Next.js and MDX.

With [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx), I can use JSX components inside my Markdown documents with ease. This way, if I want to do
something custom, it's as simple as importing a React component.

## Link Prefetching

For maximum performance, you can use the `prefetch` [attribute](https://nextjs.org/docs#prefetching-pages) on Next's `<Link>` component. This will give the perception
the page loads instantly.

- As of [Next.js 8](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-8/), `prefetch` uses `<link rel="preload">` instead of a `<script>` tag. It also only starts prefetching after `onload` to allow the browser to manage resources.
- As of [Next.js 9](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9/), `<Link>` components will be [automatically prefetched](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9#prefetching-in-viewport-links) as they appear in-viewport. You no longer need to explicitly say `prefetch`.
- As of [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13/), you no longer need to manually add `a` tags as a child of `<Link>` components.

```jsx
<Link href="/">Home</Link>
```

## Polyfills

Next.js supports all modern browsers (Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera) out of the box.
However, it's possible that your own code or external NPM dependencies might use features not supported in your target browsers. In this case,
you will need to [add polyfills](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/supported-browsers-features#custom-polyfills).

You'll need to add a top-level import for the specific polyfill you need in your Custom `<App>` or the individual component.

```js title="pages/_app.js"
// Add your polyfills here or at the component level.
// For example...
// import 'resize-observer-polyfill'

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}
```

## Vercel

[Vercel](https://vercel.com) is hands down the **easiest way to deploy applications** I've ever used.
It's incredibly easy to get started and their GitHub integration will automatically deploy your app on pull requests and leave a link
for you to review the changes. If everything looks good, it will deploy to prod when the PR is merged. Simple as that.

The icing on the cake is how well the Vercel ecosystem works together. Their [domain service](https://vercel.com/domains) allows you
to buy domains _from the command line_. I've never been able to go from an idea to a live, deployed application
hosted on a domain so fast. I was even able to setup email forwarding for my domain and create `me@leerob.io` using [improvmx](https://improvmx.com/) 🎉

**Update:** I work at Vercel now. This was written before, but still holds true 😁

## Where To Get Help

The Next.js and Vercel community support is _fantastic_. They're very responsive to emails, issues, or any other form
of contact. My preferred method would be [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions). Thanks to Discussions, all
questions and answers are indexed, searchable, and easy to find. Their [tutorials](https://nextjs.org/learn/) and [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs) are also fantastic and well-written.
