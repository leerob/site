summary: 'Learn why I switched my Next.js blog to use Tailwind CSS and how it impacted performance.'
---

My site is an opportunity to try new tech and form opinions on what I enjoy using. I learn best by building real things. After some evaluation, I've landed on the following tech stack:

- Next.js (Upgraded to `v10`)
- Tailwind CSS (Switched from Chakra UI)
- `next-mdx-remote` (Switched from `next-mdx-enhanced`)
- Deployed with Vercel

I've improved performance, added new features, and cleaned up some code. Let's dive into why I chose this tech stack.

### Next.js 10

Next.js 10 introduced the [Image Component and Automatic Image Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization). I've optimized images manually before (using ImageAlpha / ImageOptim) as well as with automated tools (like ImgBot). With Next.js 10, I no longer need to worry about that.

The `Image` component helps prevent [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/) (CLS) by defining the `width` and `height` ahead of time. No more jumping layouts. It only loads images as they're scrolled into the viewport, keeping page loads fast. Plus, images are served in modern formats like [WebP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types) when the browser supports it.

Preventing CLS required a mental model shift. Previously, my images used normal Markdown image syntax and expanded to fill the width of their container (`700px`). For example:

```jsx
![Siamese Cat](/cat.png)
```

I wanted to avoid using the `height` and `width` props of `next/image`, if possible. The `Image` component exposes different [layout props](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#layout) like `layout=fill`, which led to me believe I could [escape defining sizes](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/image-component/pages/layout-fill.js). In reality, there's no way to avoid layout shift unless you explicitly tell the layout how much space to allocate. Once that clicked in my head, the `Image` component made sense.

This meant switching from Markdown image syntax (shown above) to using `next/image` via MDX. Since I had hundreds of Markdown files, I wanted to automate this. I created a [Node script using remark](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/fb9c02b76128d91717a226e5c118b5c56e11696e/scripts/markdown-to-next-image.js) that transformed every image and read the dimensions from the file system. For example, the above Markdown image was transformed to:

```jsx
<Image alt="Siamese Cat" src="/cat.png" height={50} width={50} />
```

### Tailwind CSS

At first glance, Tailwind seems horrible. I've heard this sentiment many times and read [Adam's rebuttals](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/). Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to try Tailwind on a project. I didn't hate it. Still, I needed a larger project to form an opinion on the framework.

Well, the verdict is out. **I really enjoy Tailwind.** There was a learning curve as I tried to translate my existing CSS knowledge to Tailwind specific naming. For example, this vanilla CSS:

```css
display: flex;
flex-direction: row;
align-items: center;
```

translates to these utility classes with Tailwind:

```jsx
<div className="flex flex-row items-center" />
```

The Tailwind classes feel intuitive and their documentation makes it easy. The underlying idea of being bound to a design system made plenty of sense coming from Chakra UI. For example:

```jsx
import { Flex } from '@chakra-ui/react';

<Flex px={4} py={2} />;
```

Chakra's [spacing system](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/theming/theme#spacing) is inspired by Tailwind. 1 spacing unit is equal to `0.25rem`, which translates to `4px` by default in most browsers. In the example below, we're adding `16px` of horizontal padding and `8px` of vertical padding.

```jsx
<div className="px-4 py-2" />
```

I still enjoy Chakra for larger applications. Having pre-built UI components saves a lot of time. Their documentation has some good notes on the [differences between Tailwind](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/comparison#how-is-chakra-different-from-tailwind-css). For further reading, check out [How Should I Style My React Application?](/blog/css-with-react).

### Dark Mode

Tailwind 2.0 makes using dark mode painless. Enable the `dark` [variant](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) and prefix your classes with `dark:`. That's pretty much it.

```jsx
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800" />
```

I was able to keep a [dark mode toggle](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/91233631f0e1a193295ffc54d2291f3109060007/components/Container.tsx) in the navigation thanks to [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes). Tailwind and `next-themes` [pair well](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes#with-tailwind) together.

```jsx
import { useTheme } from 'next-themes';

const ThemeChanger = () => {
  const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme();

  return (
    <div>
      The current theme is: {theme}
      <button onClick={() => setTheme('light')}>Light Mode</button>
      <button onClick={() => setTheme('dark')}>Dark Mode</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

I hit a few issues along the way adding dark mode to Tailwind Typography. The documentation felt a bit disjointed from the rest of Tailwind. I would have expected more guidance on pairing the two together.

After digging through GitHub Issues, I was able to [get things working](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/91233631f0e1a193295ffc54d2291f3109060007/tailwind.config.js). It wasn't obvious I needed `dark:prose-dark`. I also managed to get [syntax highlighting](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/91233631f0e1a193295ffc54d2291f3109060007/styles/global.css) working through some custom styles.

## Performance

Libraries like `emotion` and `styled-system` require runtime JavaScript to compute styles and generate class names. That doesn't mean you can't use [CSS-in-JS](https://github.com/callstack/linaria) [correctly](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro). But I'd argue using "plain" CSS helps you fall into the [pit of success](https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/) ([CSS Modules](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support), Tailwind, etc) more easily.

There is no correct answer. Each has their own tradeoffs. For my simple site, I choose the performance tradeoff. I was able to reduce the [number of assets downloaded](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/cli#build) **by 43%**.

- 📦 Before → `~150kb` First Load JS
- 📈 After → `~85kb` First Load JS

This change, paired with `next/image`, has my [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics) looking incredible. Zero CLS.

<Image
  alt={`Vercel Analytics`}
  src={`/images/tailwind/analytics.jpg`}
  width={1000}
  height={782}
/>

### MDX

[Last year](/blog/mdx), I switched from using `@next/mdx` to `next-mdx-enhanced` mostly for front matter and layout support. These are now both [solved problems](https://nextjs.org/blog/markdown). Given that [next-mdx-enhanced](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-enhanced) will likely be deprecated soon (see below) I wanted to explore [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote).

> You probably should be using `next-mdx-remote` instead of this library. It is ~50% faster, more flexible with content storage, does not induce memory issues at scale, and fits much better with the way that data is intended to flow through Next.js.

With the addition of `getStaticPaths` / `getServerSideProps`, you can treat your MDX data like any other data source in Next.js. It also removes the limitation of being bound to [file-system based routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) for your `.mdx` files. Since my site has hundreds of MDX files, moving these to a top-level `data/` folder made more sense to me.

Still, the MDX experience feels _fragmented_. I'd like to merge `next-mdx-remote` with `@next/mdx` so there are fewer options. [nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra) (another related project) allows you to use methods like `getStaticProps` directly inside your MDX files. Maybe there's a path to convergence for all three.

### Other

I added [absolute Imports and module path aliases](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/module-path-aliases) to improve the readability of nested imports inside files. Here's a before and after example:

```jsx
// Before
import db from '../../lib/db-admin';

// After
import db from 'lib/db-admin';
```
