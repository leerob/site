For many teams using Next.js, setting up exception monitoring is a critical requirement before going to production.
This guide will show you how to use [Sentry](https://sentry.io) to catch & report errors on both client and server-side.

## Brief Next.js Overview

Next.js allows you to easily server-side render (SSR) your React components. All files inside the `/pages` directory will be routed based on their filename (e.g. `/pages/home.js` routes to `your-domain.com/home`).

There are a few Next-specific routes you should understand:

- `_document.js` is _server-side only_ and is used to change the initial server-side rendered document markup.
- `_app.js` is used to initialize pages.

## Implementing Sentry

There are a few different ways to integrate Sentry into your Next.js app, each with their own pros and cons. This guide will focus on a simple example and provide a reference for how to expand your Sentry setup as needed.

### Simple Setup

_You can view the completed example [here](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-sentry-simple)._

1. Set up an account with [Sentry](https://sentry.io) and retrieve your DSN.
2. Add Sentry to your project. Here is an example `package.json`.

```json:package.json
{
  "name": "with-sentry-simple",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "license": "ISC",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@sentry/browser": "^5.1.0",
    "@zeit/next-source-maps": "0.0.4-canary.1",
    "next": "latest",
    "react": "^16.8.6",
    "react-dom": "^16.8.6"
  }
}
```

3. Override `_app.js` to initialize Sentry and capture client-side exceptions using the `componentDidCatch` React lifecycle method.

```jsx:pages/_app.js
import React from 'react';
import App, { Container } from 'next/app';
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'ENTER_YOUR_SENTRY_DSN_HERE'
});

class MyApp extends App {
  static async getInitialProps({ Component, ctx }) {
    let pageProps = {};

    if (Component.getInitialProps) {
      pageProps = await Component.getInitialProps(ctx);
    }

    return { pageProps };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    Sentry.withScope((scope) => {
      Object.keys(errorInfo).forEach((key) => {
        scope.setExtra(key, errorInfo[key]);
      });

      Sentry.captureException(error);
    });

    super.componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo);
  }

  render() {
    const { Component, pageProps } = this.props;

    return (
      <Container>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </Container>
    );
  }
}

export default MyApp;
```

4. Override `_document.js` to capture server-side exceptions by listening at the node process level.

```jsx:pages/_document.js
import Document, { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';

process.on('unhandledRejection', (err) => {
  Sentry.captureException(err);
});

process.on('uncaughtException', (err) => {
  Sentry.captureException(err);
});

class MyDocument extends Document {
  static async getInitialProps(ctx) {
    const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx);
    return { ...initialProps };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Html>
        <Head />
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    );
  }
}

export default MyDocument;
```

5. Override `next.config.js` to produce source maps.

```js:next.config.js
const withSourceMaps = require('@zeit/next-source-maps')();

module.exports = withSourceMaps({
  webpack(config, _options) {
    return config;
  }
});
```

### Complex Setup

Next has an example [with-sentry](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-sentry) which contains more functionality but is also more complex. Building off the simple example, it also:

- Reports the `BUILD_ID` as a release inside Sentry.
- Contains a custom error reporting page to allow users to submit feedback.
- Uses cookies for a more accurate user count between client and server.

There are still a [few](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/1622) [issues](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/1762) with it, so I wouldn't recommend using it as a base for now.
You might be able to extract pieces of the complex example and apply them as you see fit.

## Other Notes

- Source maps will not be sent to Sentry successfully when running locally.
- It's possible you will see duplicate errors sent when testing locally due to hot reloading.
  For a more accurate simulation, please deploy to whatever service you use for hosting (e.g. Vercel).
