But once the interaction starts to provide feedback on the person's skills, it usually begins to be intrinsically rewarding.\n\n_Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience_\n\nFor me, getting into a state of flow is the only way to work productively on complex software projects.\n\nWe're going to look at some basic (and simplified) things - once you get a handle on them, you can take a big step toward productive creative work.\n\nThere are three basic resources underlying the emergence of the Flow state. They are **Time**, **Information**, and **Energy**.\n\nIn order to achieve the desired state, you must first invest each of the three resources in sufficient quality and quantity.\n\n### Time\n\n\n-   do not schedule any other activities for this time;\n-   isolate your creative space from external distractors;\n-   if you have hard time constraints, it is better to put a timer “out” so that anxiety does not interfere with your concentration;\n\n### Information\n\n-   gather all the information you need, prepare tools and materials you may need during the process;\n-   if the level of difficulty of the task exceeds your level of knowledge, skills, or abilities at the moment - get training on the subject, or select the part of the task, which you can handle right now;\n-   determine metrics for success and progress;\n\n### Energy\n\n-   the goal must be meaningful to us personally;\n-   try to start with the hardest part;\n-   the most important thing is (just) to begin to act;\n\nUsually, when the flow has started, our level of energy and power exceeds our daily level, we can do more, and our level of skill increases as well.  \nOn the way out, we feel energized. Despite the hard work, we do not feel exhausted, maybe just a pleasant fatigue or even a rush of energy and emotional lift.\n\n### How long can you stay in a flow state?\n\nThe brain can’t stay in flow all the time. In a creative, flow state, the mind works optimally for about 90 minutes to 2 hours. You can make the most of this time with techniques like the Pomodoro method. Focused periods alternated with brief periods of rest allow your brain to be it's most efficient and creative without triggering burnout.\n\n### Bonus!

Middleware functions can no longer be nested, but must now be in a single root Middleware, one code file written in either TypeScript or JavaScript. The docs say that this is both faster and cheaper. It remains possible to execute code based on request paths or other conditions.\n\nAnother change is that Middleware can no longer generate a response body, but instead must use rewrite or redirect to modify an incoming request. There are also changes to the cookie API.\n### The Edge\nTraditionally, the codebase is fully run on the origin servers. Depending on the location of the application servers (regional or multi-regional), user locations, and server configuration, the performance and latency can be an issue. With the lightweight Edge runtime, many components have been offloaded to the globally distributed Edge infrastructure, which drastically improves user experience. New in this version is Edge API routes, for building APIs using the same Next.js Edge Runtime used by Middleware. Edge API routes are in beta. Another new feature, designated as experimental, is an option to use Edge server rendering with the Edge Runtime instead of Node.js for server-side rendering of pages. The documentation states that the Edge Runtime has “lower latency as well as a better scalability.”\n### On-Demand Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR).\nAnother feature now declared stable is on-demand incremental static regeneration, a feature added in beta in Next.js 12.1. Incremental means that static page regeneration can be done on a page-by-page basis, with no need to rebuild an entire site. On-demand means that a revalidation API can be called when content changes. This enables the faster delivery of pages with the most current information.\n### `next/future/image` component\nThis is a preview of the upcoming next/image component, which is built to improve performance and solve several pain points of the current version (mainly due to the opinionated nature when the component was first released)","coverImage":{"_type":"image","alt":"text","asset":{"_ref":"image-704c82a21bc3dc668e27050b37cfbb8038aa6c8b-750x422-webp","_type":"reference"}},"slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"next-js-12-2-release"},"tags":[{"_key":"563df615c9cd","_ref":"4d245f51-9d54-4d73-ba14-8bb583f7fa02","_type":"reference"}],"title":"Next.js 12.2 Release"}
