Last week, I posted a new article entitled [Technical Recruiting is Broken](/blog/technical-recruiting-is-broken/).
I gave my thoughts, ideas for improvement, and praise to those who set great examples of how to connect
with and recruit talent in the tech industry. It seems people tended to agree.

If you're just joining my newsletter, welcome 👋🏼
I'd like to highlight two articles that aren't new, but I've just re-read in the past week that really resonate with me.

- **[How To Be Successful](http://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful) by Sam Altman** – 
Regardless of your profession/industry, this article sheds some sage advice for what differentiates "successful" people from others.
- **[Why You're Having Trouble Hiring](http://blairreeves.me/2018/08/30/why-youre-having-trouble-hiring/) by Blair Reeves** – 
As we've been discussing created a distributed workforce more and more at Hy-Vee, I keep coming back to this article. It highlights some solid reasons why you'd want to work in a low cost of living area versus SF/NYC.
