Today, I turn 26 🥳 It's been a crazy year full of new adventures,
personal growth, and exciting opportunities.

- I started my [new role at Hy-Vee](/blog/joining-hy-vee) last October.
- I've been preparing to speak at [Talent42 in Seattle](https://www.talent42.com/agenda/speakers/425777).
- I've published [multiple](/blog/benefits-i-care-about-in-2019) [successful](/blog/technical-recruiting-is-broken) [blog posts](/blog), leading to consistent traffic growth of my blog.
- I also launched [Hy-Vee's tech blog](https://medium.com/hy-vee-engineering), which has been a positive recruiting tool.

There's also one more project I've been working on, which I'm excited to share has launched today!
I've been doing freelance design & development work for BeyondHQ for the past 3 months.

Their mission is to expand tech-enabled economic opportunity beyond Silicon Valley, which directly aligns with my own goals.
It's been a great opportunity. Today, [the site goes live](http://beyondhq.co/)!

I've also wrote a new post [Configuring Sentry for Next.js Apps](/blog/configuring-sentry-for-nextjs-apps/).
For many teams using Next.js, setting up exception monitoring is a critical requirement before going to production.
This guide will show you how to use [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) to catch & report errors on both client and server-side.
