Only one week until I speak at [Talent42 in Seattle](https://www.talent42.com/agenda/speakers/425777)!
I'll share out the recording of the presentation in an upcoming newsletter.
Since the last update, I've written one new post called [How to Print in React Using Iframes](/blog/how-to-print-in-react-using-iframes/).

I'm also excited to share I'll be speaking Downtown Des Moines at [Prairie.Code()](https://prairiecode.amegala.com/Speakers)
this September! I'll be talking about best practices for building UI component libraries
on the UI/UX track.

Finally, I've been working on a tool for [BeyondHQ](https://www.beyondhq.co/geo-eval) that allows companies to easily find out
where to open their new engineering hub. All design & development was done by me 💁🏻‍
[Check it out!](https://www.beyondhq.co/geo-eval)
