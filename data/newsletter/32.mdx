After two weeks off work, I'm excited to jump back into content creation. Lots of major life events (belated honeymoon, moving into a new home) allowed me time to step away from work and refocus.

I can't be the only one seeing a massive influx of "[Web 3](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-web3/)" content on my [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/hghmls/status/1433234653490683907), right? It seems folks have hit the jackpot creating NFTs, causing a gold rush to begin. While I'm cautiously pessimistic of this wave, I've been diving deeper to understand what the hype is all about. I'm working on a blog post - let me know if you're in the crypto space and want to share insights.

I'm seeing a wave of platforms (site builders, SaaS products, and more) being built on Vercel and Next.js. [Super](https://super.so/) takes a Notion page and outputs a beautiful site with incredible performance. They're growing rapidly, serving [100 million pages](https://twitter.com/TrillCyborg/status/1432404103611568133) this month alone and just passed 500K ARR. [Hashnode](https://townhall.hashnode.com/powerful-and-superfast-hashnode-blogs-now-powered-by-nextjs-11-and-vercel), a developer blogging platform, recently [migrated its entire custom infrastructure](https://townhall.hashnode.com/powerful-and-superfast-hashnode-blogs-now-powered-by-nextjs-11-and-vercel) over to Vercel and Next.js. Site builders like [Makeswift](https://www.makeswift.com/), [Typedream](https://typedream.com/), [Motif](https://motif.land/), and more are enabling anyone to publish their next project. I mean, look at these templates from [Motif](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1422762335442190338) and [Super](https://super.so/market) 😍

## Updates

- Learn how I migrated my Next.js website to use [MySQL with PlanetScale](/blog/mysql-planetscale), resulting in 10x faster response times for my APIs.
- I made a [new video on Fauna + Next.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92qPXQa_BUQ), showing how to fetch data from a GraphQL API with Next.js and then deploy to the edge with Vercel.
- I wrote a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1430177168307412998) about using databases in Edge & Serverless environments. I'm working on turning this into a longer blog post – let me know if you'd like to provide feedback on an early draft.
- [I updated my site](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/pull/354) to Next.js 11.1, switched to built-in ESM support for ESM-only packages, and also switched to mdx-bundler for 40% faster builds.
- I switched from Buttondown to [Revue](/snippets/revue). Buttondown is nice (writing emails in Markdown is helpful) but $30/month isn't worth my infrequent email updates. With Twitter acquiring Revue and adding the ability to subscribe to newsletters directly from your profile, I'm giving Revue a shot. If you want to learn more, Chris has a [nice article here](https://www.ctnicholas.dev/articles/integrate-twitter-newsletters-with-api-routes).

## Next.js Update

- [Next.js 11.1](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-11-1) was released with ES Modules support, performance improvements, Rust-based tooling for faster builds coming soon, 2x faster data fetching when pre-rendering, and more.
- [SWR 1.0](https://swr.vercel.app/blog/swr-v1) was released with a 41% smaller core, 52% smaller installation size, improved SSR and SSG features, middleware support, custom cache providers, and more.
- We've released new [documentation on testing](https://nextjs.org/docs/testing), including examples for usage with Jest, React Testing Library, and Cypress.
- A new RFC was published for [Global CSS Imports](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/27953), allowing dependencies (`node_modules`) to import `.css` files that are not CSS Modules.
- A new RFC was published for [Crawler-Aware ISR Fallback](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/28180), allowing web crawlers to server-render [ISR pages](https://vercel.com/docs/next.js/incremental-static-regeneration) using `fallback: true`, while still serving the previous behavior of the fallback state to non-crawler User-Agents.
- We hosted a [Next.js AMA](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/27687) with the DevRel Team, where we answered questions from the community.
