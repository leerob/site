## I'm launching a new course called React 2025!

Despite your best guess, no, this is not a conference. [React 2025](https://react2025.com/) is a brand-new course showing you how to develop websites _like it's 2025_. We'll build and deploy a modern Jamstack application using the most popular open-source software.

_Here's the twist._

In my last course, I showed how to build an application with a database, authentication, and more. But I never launched the app.
This course will show the journey from zero lines of code to production for a real SaaS app. This isn't another example. At the end of the course, **I'm launching the product.**

I can't decide if I'm more excited about the course or the product. If this sounds interesting, check out [this fancy landing page](https://react2025.com/) with more information. Since I use one newsletter with tags to segment the audience, you're already along for the ride 🚀

I'm also pretty happy with the logo I designed.

## Next.js 9.4

[Next.js 9.4](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-4) was released with a _ton_ of awesome features. One I'm particularly excited about is [performance reporting](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/measuring-performance).
I updated my site to try out some of the new features.

I created a dashboard with [Quickmetrics](https://quickmetrics.io/) to track Core Web Vitals over time.
Here's [the code](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1259953687784554502/photo/2) if you're curious.

I also tried to [optimize performance](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1262067117379158020). The biggest improvement was optimizing my font loading strategy. By preloading & preconnecting to Google Fonts, I saw a notable page load decrease.

**Note:** I tried to switch to Preact, but it broke Fast Refresh. I'm guessing this will be fixed soon. Preact _did_ decrease my page load time even further.
