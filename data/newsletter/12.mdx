for reaching them. Overall, **I met 90% of my goals**.

## New Articles

Since my last update, I've written 6 new articles 😍

- [Why Should You Learn Next.js?](https://masteringnextjs.com/learn-next-js)
- [Create a Newsletter with Next.js API Routes and Mailchimp](/blog/mailchimp-next-js)
- [Next.js vs. Gatsby vs. Create React App](https://masteringnextjs.com/nextjs-gatsby-create-react-app/)

I've also launched a 50+ lesson video course on Next.js & React called [**Mastering Next.js**](https://masteringnextjs.com/) 🎉

I've been following other Indie Makers / Course Creators and have watched how they roll out
new products and services. That led me to launch Mastering Next.js *without* all the
content finished. Instead, I opted for a pre-order option. This helped me validate my
idea and demonstrate there's a market for the course. It's already paid off -
Mastering Next.js has ~\$1500 pre-launch revenue 💸
