## Overview

In the first three parts of the series, we learned how to fetch data from a variety of APIs.
Now, we can consume this data visually to build our dashboard.

## SWR

[SWR](https://swr.now.sh/) is a React Hooks library for remote data fetching.
SWR first returns the data from cache (stale), then sends the fetch request (revalidate), and finally comes with the up-to-date data again.

This is important for our dashboard page because it can be left open and the data will remain fresh.
If you re-focus or switch between tabs, SWR will [automatically revalidate data](https://swr.now.sh/#focus-revalidation).

To use SWR, we can import the hook and define which route to fetch.

```js
import useSWR from 'swr';

const { data } = useSWR('/api/unsplash', fetcher);
```

`fetcher` is a small wrapper around `fetch` returning `json`.

```js
export default async function (...args) {
  const res = await fetch(...args);

  return res.json();
}
```

`data` will contain the JSON response from our API route.

```json
// /api/unsplash

{
  "downloads": 7995,
  "views": 1134429
}
```

## Consuming the Data

Now that you have access to the data from the route, you can build a UI to consume the data.
I've chosen to create "cards" for each metric.

```js:components/metrics/Unsplash.js
import React from 'react';
import useSWR from 'swr';
import format from 'comma-number';

import fetcher from '../../lib/fetcher';

import MetricCard from './card';

function Unsplash() {
  const { data } = useSWR('/api/unsplash', fetcher);

  const downloads = format(data?.downloads);
  const views = format(data?.views);
  const link = 'https://unsplash.com/@leerob';

  return (
    <>
      <MetricCard header="Unsplash Downloads" link={link} metric={downloads} />
      <MetricCard header="Unsplash Views" link={link} metric={views} />
    </>
  );
}

export default Unsplash;
```

_Note_: The `MetricCard` source code is [here](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/master/components/metrics/Card.js).

## Example

The two cards below talk to `/api/unsplash` and pull back stats about my Unsplash account.
